Summary of Research Findings:
In the course of our research project, our main goal was to determine the most effective method for predicting solar power output using various machine-learning techniques. We thoroughly tested three distinct methods: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT).
Throughout our experiments, we intentionally avoided favouring any specific platform, such as Google Colab, to ensure that our evaluation focused solely on how well each method handled weather data and performed in predicting the solar output.
The outcomes of our experiments revealed some interesting findings. LSTM, when applied to weather data, exhibited a remarkable efficiency, boasting an accuracy of approximately 89%. On the other hand, MLP, another method utilizing the same weather data, demonstrated an efficiency of around 83%. The GBRT method showcased an efficiency level of about 82%, while KNN displayed an efficiency of around 81%.
Concluding Remarks:
In simpler terms, our research leads us to the clear conclusion that LSTM stands out as the most effective method among the ones tested, with an impressive 89% accuracy. This signifies that LSTM is a highly reliable choice for accurately predicting solar power output across different scenarios. It's crucial to note that our results are based on the inherent capabilities of each method, and we intentionally avoided any bias related to specific platforms or tools. Our research contributes valuable insights for those interested in employing machine learning for solar power forecasting, emphasizing the superiority of LSTM in this context.
